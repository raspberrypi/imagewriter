# System Requirements
## Windows
Raspberry Pi Imager runs on the following versions of Windows:

- Window 7
- Windows 8
- Windows 8.1
- Windows 10

The system must have hardware-accelerated graphics. 
Usually this means you simply need to have the correct drivers for your graphics card installed.
However, if you are running Windows within a virtualised environment, e.g Oracle VirtualBox, 
then Raspberry Pi Imager may fail to run due to the lack of hardware acceleration.
